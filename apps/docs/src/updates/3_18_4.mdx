### Scroll lock

Added the behavior that when opening a Modal, the scroll of the entire browser is blocked. You can disable/enable this behavior using 
the **scrollLock** prop; its default value is always false. Therefore, to enable it for all Modals in your app, add this line in:
**src/components/index.tsx**:

```tsx
LibComponents.Modal.defaultProps.scrollLock = true
```

### Auto index

Added the behavior of automatically setting the zIndex of Modals. Previously, it was possible that when opening a Modal on top of another 
Modal, the second one would end up behind instead of on top. You can disable/enable this behavior using the **autoIndex** prop; its default value 
is always false. Therefore, to enable it for all Modals in your app, add this line in **src/components/index.tsx**:

```tsx
LibComponents.Modal.defaultProps.autoIndex = true
```

### Global access

It is no longer necessary to pass props such as 'visible' and 'toggle'; you can now open or close a Modal from anywhere in the code with just one 
function called **toggleModal**

First, you must define an ID for your Modal

```tsx
function ModalExample() {
  return (
    <Modal modalId='modal-example' />
  )
}
```

Now you can call this Modal as follows

```ts
import { toggleModal } from '@codeleap/web'

function triggerModal() {
  toggleModal('modal-example')
}
```
