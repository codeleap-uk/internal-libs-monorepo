### OSAlert

A feature that allows you to easily show stylized Alerts to the user instead of system Alerts, making it easy and simple to use in the code.

Now the OSAlert module has been added' to the common package and both mobile applications and web applications can use this functionality.

Example of how it can be used:

```tsx
import { CreateOSALert } from '@codeleap/common'

const OSAlert = CreateOSALert()
```

It is necessary to create a **GlobalAlert** that uses the **Alert** Component together with the **OSAlertStore** that comes from codeleap/common. 

##### Mobile

This is a new functionality for mobile applications.

To implement this in your app, you can follow the [CHANGELOG of this PR](https://github.com/codeleap-uk/mobile-template/pull/87).

##### Web

To implement this in your app, you can follow the [CHANGELOG of this PR](https://github.com/codeleap-uk/web-template/pull/67).

Previously, this functionality was already available in the web package, but the code would be very similar for the 
mobile package, which is why the decision was made to refactor the OSAlert module to be used on both platforms and 
consequently move it to the common package.

However, some projects already use this specific OSAlert for the web, and for those projects that do not want to make the 
transition, it is possible to continue using it, but it is necessary to change the import path to the deprecated module:

```tsx
import { 
  CreateOSAlert, 
  GlobalAlertComponentProps, 
  GlobalAlertType, 
  useGlobalAlertComponent 
} from '@codeleap/web/dist/lib/deprecated'

// ...
```
