### AppAuthErrors

Functionality to handle authentication errors: login, signup, profile editing and social login.

It offers several errors by default with personalized messages, in addition to being able to customize these standard errors and add new errors.

You can access this in the common package, so it can be used for mobile and web apps, sharing the same integration and implementation code.

Example of how it can be used:

```tsx
import { AppAuthErrors } from '@codeleap/common'

export const AuthErrors = new AppAuthErrors({}, (err, module, args) => {
  const msg = err?.msg?.(args)

  OSAlert.error({ title: I18N.t('error'), body: msg })
})
```
