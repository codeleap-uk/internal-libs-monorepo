title: 'Integration with React Native 0.73'
---

### Template Mobile

Some quick updates:

- Added email verification.
- Added Tag component.
- Added ProgressBar and ProgressCircle components.
- Added PhoneInput.
- Fixed NotificationsEvents.

But the most important: the template upgrades from React Native version 0.70.6 to the latest version: 0.73.1! 
Check out some important updates:

##### Node Version

The minimum Node version to run the mobile template is now 18.

##### Java Version

Now, it is necessary to have Java 17 to build Android.

You can download the version directly by [clicking here!](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17) After installing, it's necessary to 
change the **JAVA_HOME** variable to the path of the new version, for example:

```
export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/temurin-17.jdk/Contents/Home
```

> INFO This will affect other apps with a React Native version lower than 0.73; they will still need JAVA 11. If the variable points 
> to version 17, the following error will occur:
> "Android Gradle plugin requires Java 11 to run. You are currently using Java 17"

##### Gap component is discontinued

From now on, the Gap component is deprecated! The **gap** property has been added to React Native, functioning in the same way as on the web.

Additionally, there have been other interesting changes to styles. I recommend quickly reading the official documentation for more details.

##### Other interesting updates

- The build time for Android has been significantly affected; however, using cache can reduce the installation time to just 25 seconds.
- Kotlin replaces Java and becomes the recommended language for React Native.
- Addition of React Native's own debugger in an experimental phase, with the aim of replacing Flipper in the future.
- The minimum iOS version is now 13.4.

### Changes to Monorepo node_modules folders

The way node_modules are installed has been changed, and you may encounter issues. Therefore, before doing anything in this new 
version, execute the following commands:

1. yarn cleanNodeModules
2. yarn
3. yarn build
