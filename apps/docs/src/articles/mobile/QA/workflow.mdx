# QA Mobile testing workflow
Android and iOS builds take a while to finish, and for testers that need to switch branches often, it can be a pain to wait for the build to finish. We use [Microsoft Codepush](https://microsoft.github.io/code-push/) to allow developers to release updates for the QA team to test without having to wait for a new build.

## Process

1. The tester installs the QA variant of the app
2. A developer makes changes to the app and opens a pull request
3. Once the PR is open, the developer pushes the changes to a codepush deployment
4. The tester installs the codepush deployment to test the changes through the in-app UI
