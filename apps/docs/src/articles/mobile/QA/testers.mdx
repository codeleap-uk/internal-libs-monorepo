Clone a repository, and make sure you have the release keystores and their configurations on the android/app/keystores folder. A device or emulator should also be available

Run the following commands
``` 
adb reverse tcp:8081 tcp:8081
yarn
yarn installQa
```

This should install the app to the device/emulator

Once a developer has created a branch and uploaded it's contents to codepush, you may switch to it by:

1. Pressing "Change deployment" on the initial screen of the app (while logged out)
2. Selecting the branch you want to test
3. Pressing "Sync" on the modal that pops up
