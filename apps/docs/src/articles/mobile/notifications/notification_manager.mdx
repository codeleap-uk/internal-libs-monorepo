## How to use

```tsx
import { NotificationManager } from '@codeleap/mobile'

export const notificationManager = new NotificationManager(logger, options)
```

You can pass two arguments:

- logger: will be used to debug any essential events.
- options: important configurations.

### Options

- handleInitialNotification(*boolean* - default is *true*): enable or disable the app's initial notification.

```tsx
import { NotificationManager } from '@codeleap/mobile'

export const notificationManager = new NotificationManager(logger, {
  handleInitialNotification: true,
})
```

- debug(*boolean* - default is *false*): enable or disable debug mode, which logs various useful information to understand what is happening with notifications.

```tsx
import { NotificationManager } from '@codeleap/mobile'

export const notificationManager = new NotificationManager(logger, {
  debug: IsDev,
})
```

- slackDebug(*boolean* - default is *false*): enable or disable logs to Slack. If enabled, all debug information goes to the Slack channel. 

This can be very useful for understanding what is happening with notifications in release.

```tsx
import { NotificationManager } from '@codeleap/mobile'

export const notificationManager = new NotificationManager(logger, {
  slackDebug: false,
})
```

- parser(*function* - default is *null*): a function that is called in the handlers to process the notification before passing it to the events.

This function receives a message of type **Message**, which is the notification received from Firebase without any processing. 
It should return the type passed as the first argument to the **NotificationManager**.

```tsx
import { NotificationManager, Message } from '@codeleap/mobile'

type Notification = {
  text: string
}

function parser(message: Message): Notification {
  return {
    text: message.body
  }
}

export const notificationManager = new NotificationManager<Notification>(logger, {
  parser: false,
})
```

### Important Methods

#### registerEvent

Function that registers an event to be called by the notification services, returning an unsubscribe function if necessary.

```tsx
const unsubscribe = notificationManager.registerEvent('event_name', (notification) => {
  ...
})
```

It receives two arguments:

- The name of the event, the typing of which must be passed as the second type argument to the NotificationManager.

```tsx
type NotificationEventName = 'event_name' | 'other_event'

export const notificationManager = new NotificationManager<Notification, NotificationEventName>(logger)
```

- The event-related function that receives a notification with data (the return from the parser function) and type (the type of notification), and you can handle or execute whatever you need.

#### getToken

Async function that retrieves the current device token. If the return is null, an error occurred while trying to obtain the token.

```tsx
const deviceToken = await notificationManager.getToken()
```

#### getHasAuthorization

Async function that checks if the application has authorization to initialize notification services. It returns a boolean true if it does.

```tsx
const hasAuthorization = await notificationManager.getHasAuthorization()
```

#### initialize

Function that initializes all notification services and retrieves the device token to return in the callback function.

```tsx
notificationManager.initialize((token) => {
  ...
})
```

The following services are started:

- **onNotificationOpenedApp**: Triggered when the app is in the background and is opened by a notification. Its notification type is *'press'*.

- **getInitialNotification**: Triggered when the app is closed and is opened by a notification. Its notification type is *'initial'*.

- **onBackgroundMessage**: Triggered when the app is in the background. Its notification type is *'background'*.

- **onMessage**: Triggered when the app is in the foreground. Its notification type is *'foreground'*.

- **onTokenRefresh**: Triggered when the device token is refreshed. The callback function is called.

After initializing these services, it registers the unsubscribe event of each one, and always executes all of them before initialization, ensuring that a service is not duplicated.

#### deinitialize

Function that removes all active notification services by unsubscribing from each one. You can pass a callback function that will be called when the process is completed.

## Implementation

Create a hook that will be responsible for either initializing or deinitializing the notification service, and call it in your main file, typically located in scenes/index.tsx.

```tsx
import React from 'react'
import { APIClient, usePermissions } from '@/services'
import { notificationManager } from './manager'

export const useNotificationsManager = () => {
  const { isLoggedIn } = APIClient.Session.useSession()
  const permissions = usePermissions()

  React.useEffect(() => {
    const func = async () => {
      const hasAuthorization = await notificationManager.getHasAuthorization()

      // Check if the user is logged in and if the application has notification permissions
      if (isLoggedIn && hasAuthorization) {
        // Initialize notification services
        notificationManager.initialize((token) => {
          // Register the device token
          APIClient.Notifications.registerDevice(token)
        })
      } else {
        // Remove notification services
        notificationManager.deinitialize()
      }
    }

    func()
  }, [
    // Watch if the user is logged in
    isLoggedIn,
    // Watch notification events
    notificationManager.events.subscribers,
    // Watch notification permissions for any changes
    permissions.state.notifications
  ])
}
```

```tsx
import { useNotificationsManager } from 'path'

export default function App() {
  ...

  useNotificationsManager()

  ...
}
```
