- It is worth reminding that our entire documentation is a constant work in progress.

- For development tasks, when starting every project it is best to go through the main features and considering whether we need to implement any improvements into the template that could be used in future apps, so we keep adding to our pool of available resources.

- Similarly, if you have any suggestions on how to improve our Notion docs, please let us know! Let's write down great documentation together :)

# Writing/patching documentation

Clone the `internal-libs-monorepo` repository and navigate to `apps/docs/src/articles`, the folder which contains all of the documentation pages, in the `.mdx` format.

> TIP If you are not familiar with MDX, read more about it [here](https://mdxjs.com/docs/what-is-mdx/).

The structure of this folder is as follows:

- {module}
    - {category}
        - ...articles
    - ...articles without category
    - order.json (file used for determining order of articles on navbar and automatically assigning previous and next buttons at their end)

Where:

- {module} is one of: mobile, common, web, cli or "concepts", which is a category of it's own dedicated to holding documentation about our culture, procedures, and overarching technical concepts
- {category} is the subgroup of articles inside the documentation of a module, so for a component library, you could have `components` and `hooks` categories to separate content. If a category is not specified (the .mdx file is at the root of the module's folder), it's simply placed at the root in the navbar.

The `order.json` file at the root of each `module` has the following structure:
```json
[
    {
        "name": "root",
        "items": [
            "index",
            "typescript"
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "workflow",
        "items": [
            "contributing",
            "pr-template",
            "management"
        ]
    },
    {
        "name": "styling",
        "items": [
            "fundamentals",
            "theme"
        ]
    }
]
```

The example above produces the following output

![Order output](order_json_output.png)

For each of these objects, name can be either `root` or the name of the folder in which the mdx file resides. If name is root, links to articles are placed on the top level of the navbar without a dropdown ("Welcome to Codeleap" and "Typescript 101" in the example above). 

`items` is an array of the filenames inside the folder (or beside the order file if `name` is `root`), which dictates their order of exhibition.

Keep in mind that the title displayed in the navbar is determined inside the `mdx` file itself

So, in summary, just determine where what you wish to write should go based on the existing folder structure, and where in the order of articles it should be placed, then start writing.

## About styling

If you feel the need to change styles of some part of the documentation `apps/docs/src/components/mdxTransforms.tsx` is your file. Each markdown tag maps directly to one of the html tags defined in the file. You may use any React features inside the functions assigned to these html tags.

## Guidelines for writing documentation

- Order articles so that they can be read sequentially while improving upon the understanding of previous articles.
- When you reference some other part of the documentation, add a link to make navigation easier. Relative paths are supported. If you reference an external resource, add a link as well.
- Add nice titles to what you write.
- Include examples when talking about code, it makes everything easier.
- If you wish to add information that is not vital to the content of the article itself, use `blockquotes`. They will be styled according to their types (Annotated directly at the start).
    - To add a blockquote to the article, use the following syntax: 
    ```markdown
    > NOTE this is a note
    > WARNING You've been warned 
    > TIP It's a great idea, I'm telling you
    > INFO You really should knnow this
    ```

# Contributing to packages

We have a few packages published

- @codeleap/common - Things that are going to be used everywhere
- @codeleap/cli - Helpful commands for development
- @codeleap/mobile - Components, hooks and utilities for use with react-native
- @codeleap/web - Components, hooks and utilities for developing websites
- @codeleap/config - Our common configuration for eslint

The source code for these packages resides at the `packages/` folder in the root of [this](https://github.com/codeleap-uk/internal-libs-monorepo) repository.
