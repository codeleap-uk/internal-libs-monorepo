# CodeLeap Pull Request Template

*Pro tip: click the "Preview" tab above to understand WTF is going on, then edit accordingly.*

## What is this about?
PREFACE: In an effort to improve the teams’s efficiency and developer independence, we’re moving towards increased reliance in processes and methods to perform and review tasks.

⚠️ **THE CODELEAP DEVELOPER BIBLE**
1. Never commit to main/master in production projects, and avoid doing so in development unless there’s a good reason to do so. It is always best to get someone else’s feedback of your work before clients do. [Check branching guidelines here.](../management)
2. Developers at CodeLeap should be independent and resolve issues by contacting peers, getting feedback from them and resolving product and technical issues.
3. It does not matter *how* or *who* resolves an issue. *What matters is resolving the clients issues*. Resourcefulness is as important as technical ability. Be resourceful and always aim to resolve the client’s issue as fast and efficiently as possible.
4. The reviewer is not a tester, and much less so are the clients. It is the assignee’s responsibility to make sure their implementations work on every platform, in any relevant scenario for the project. The reviewer's job is to proof read and ensure outstanding technical and usability quality.
5. Be mindful of collateral changes and think about the future. Good developers are only accurately identified after their code passes the test of time. Build things to be clear, avoid refactors in the future and avoid leaving technical debt behind.
6. Make sure your pull requests meet all the criteria in this PR checklist - **making good shit is our top priority.**
7. Please ask the team any questions that arise during development - you can never be too clear!

## Best Practices Checklist

Make sure you follow these best coding practices:

- [ ]  [DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
- [ ]  [KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)
- [ ]  Reuse existing code - check whether what you've done could be done by reusing or modifying similar components or functions
- [ ]  [Use variants wisely](/concepts/styling/fundamentals) - check for best usage of existing variants or create new variants (when relevant); make sure variant sequences are not repeating themselves (DRY) or are redundant with styles object
- [ ]  [No arbitrary values](/concepts/styling/theme#the%20theme:~:text=default%20variant%27s%20style.-,The%20theme,-Themes%20provide%20values) - always use flex, Theme, variants or something intelligent and responsive to define styles
- [ ]  [Consistently bad is better than inconsistently good](https://jgefroh.medium.com/why-consistency-is-one-of-the-top-indicators-of-good-code-352ba5d62020#:~:text=Consistently%20bad%20is%20better%20than%20inconsistently%20good.) - make sure your code is similar to rest of the code
- [ ]  [Self documenting code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-documenting_code) - make sure your functions and variable names explain what they actually do
- [ ]  Cleanup - leave consistent empty line spacing, remove logs, remove uneeded commented code, etc...
- [ ]  Make linter happy
- [ ]  Link this PR to its issue and update anything needed on the board

## Project Checklist

Test your changes while:

- [ ]  Logged out
- [ ]  Logged in as a regular user
- [ ]  Anything else?

Also make sure (*strike out if not applicable*):

- [ ]  `Input` -> If you added/changed an `input` field - check it has adequate:
    - [ ]  Placeholders
    - [ ]  Labels
    - [ ]  “onSubmitEdit” handling
    - [ ]  Keyboard type
    - [ ]  Text data type
- [ ]  `List` and `grids` -> If you added/changed a list of items of any kind - check it scrolls and works correctly when having varying number of items (0, 1, 2, 3, 9+, etc...)
- [ ]  `Fetch, loading and AppStatus` -> If you display any content fetched from the server, make sure we correctly handle a loading indication through local UI changes (spinner) or using AppStatus as needed. Also make sure the page renders correctly after refreshing (not coming from another screen)
- [ ]  `Placeholders & missing content` -> Also when displaying fetched content of any kind, make sure to handle when there is no content by showing a placeholder or hiding the item. Check object properties that might not always exist and handle UI accordingly
- [ ]  `Formatting` -> If you use any formattable data like numbers, currencies, date or time, make sure they're formatted in the best way for the users
- [ ]  `Dependencies` -> If you add dependencies like packages, images or fonts, make sure they're all commited (including patch-package if relevant) and will work from a clean repo/yarn install on all platforms

## Operating System Test Checklist

- [ ]  Android
