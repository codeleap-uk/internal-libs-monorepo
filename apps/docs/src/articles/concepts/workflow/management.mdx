# Branching

To save us from becoming a complete mess, we follow a basic git flow (see below). As of now we don't need anything fancy. The orange lane represents hot-fixes, the blue one in the middle the master version, and the green lanes are for developing features or experimenting.

First of all, I really recommend using SourceTree or some other visual git inspector so that you can actually understand what the hell is going on.

Branches must be named as "type/YYMM-name", YYMM being the due milestone. For example:

- `feature/YYMM-something-new` 
- `fix/YYMM-some-bug`
