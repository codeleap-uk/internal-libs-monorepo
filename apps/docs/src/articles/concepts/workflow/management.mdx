# Branching


## Naming and separation

Branching methodology changes according to the tasks to be performed for a given branch, and can be broadly divided into two categories

### Big or atomic tasks:

This category encompasses

- Developing new screens/features
- Integrating with a Service
- Refactoring part of a codebase
- Experimenting with different libraries or ways to solve a problem

For this type of task, it's generally better to name branches in the following manner depending on the changes/additions to be made

- For features/screens: `feat/<screen or feature name>`
- For integrations: `feat/<service name>-integration`
- For refactors: `refactor/<module to refactor>`
- For experiments: `experiment/<library or solution name>`

This makes it easy to track development accross multiple PR's with different collaborators, and test if what's developed works as expected without external interference before trying to integrate with other branches

### Collections of small fixes

This category is generally related to a Notion task with multiple bullet points refering to small fixes to be made to the application.

To work with sprints and our weekly reviews for every project, these sort of branches would ideally follow the guidelines below:

- Be named `fixes/<day of the review>-<month of the review>`
- Have a link to the related Notion task
- Be merged at most 7 after their creation

## Tracking the status of branches

When starting a new branch, it's good to open a PR as soon as possible. This allows reviewers to quickly see what's being changed in the project all at once, and choose to test what's been developed.

If work on the branch has not been finished yet, prefix the PR's title with "WIP" (meaning work in progress), to let people know it's not done yet.

Once done, remove "WIP" from the title and request the review of those involved in the project
