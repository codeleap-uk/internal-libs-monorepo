At Codeleap, we use a styling system which aims to provide a fast development experience without compromising quality or flexibility. The base of this system is the concept of *variants*.

Variants can be described as a set of styles for a component's *composition* (it's internal components). For instance, a simple Button component can be broken down into it's Wrapper, Text, and Icon. These three elements make up the Button's composition. 

A *variant* of such a Button will modify one or more of the composition's elements, resulting in a different style which can be applied to the Button by referencing it's name in the variants prop.

```javascript
const ButtonStyles = {
    default: {
        text: {
            color: 'red'
        },
        wrapper: {
            backgroundColor: 'white',
        }
    },
    dark: {
        wrapper: {
            backgroundColor: 'black',
        },
    }
}
```

In the above example, de `default` variant is defined with a `red` color for the text, and `white` for the wrapper (effectively the background).

The `dark` variant modifies the background to be `black`.

When we render our Button component without specifying any variants, like so:

```jsx
<Button text='Default'/>
```

This is the result:

<button style={{backgroundColor: 'white', color:'red'}}>Default</button>

But once the `dark` variant is applied: 

```jsx
<Button text='Dark' variants={['dark']} />
```
<button style={{backgroundColor: 'black', color:'red'}}>Dark</button>

Notice only the background has changed. That's because every variant inherits de default variant's style.
