title: Typescript 101

This will cover some helpful typescript concepts so you can work with our template more effectively

# Types

A type can be something as basic as

```typescript
type MyString = string

type MyBool= boolean

type MyNumber = number

type MyObject = {
    property: string
    otherProperty: number
}
```

These can be used with both variables and functions, as well as generics (which we'll get into later)

```typescript
const someNumber:MyNumber = 10

const sayHello = (name: MyString) => {
    console.log(`Hi ${name}`)
}
```

Now we'll get into some other useful typescript features

# Unions

Say you have a component which accepts a variant prop. The value of this prop should be one of the following variants

round 
OR
square

To represent such a thing with typescript, we can use Union types

```typescript

// You may look at this as an OR(||) sign. It basically means that 
// whatever value is assigned to a variable of this type
// should be either 'round' or 'square'
type VariantProp = 'round' | 'square'

// No error
const a:VariantProp = 'round' 

// Error, since triangle is not a member of the VariantProp Union
const b:VariantProp = 'triangle' 

type ComponentProps = {
    variant: VariantProp
}

```

Unions themselves may be used to make other types. For instance, if we wanted the component to accept multiple variants

```typescript
// The "[]" at the end means "an array of whatever type is between the first bracket and the equals sign"
type VariantList = VariantProp[]

// Success
const  a:VariantList = ['square','round'] 

// Error, since triangle is not a member of the VariantProp Union
const  b:VariantList = ['triangle','round'] 

type ComponentProps = {
    variant: VariantList
}
```

It's not limited to strings either, if we wanted the component to accept either a `Date` or a `string` as it's date prop 

```typescript
type ComponentProps = {
    date: Date | string
}
```

Any type can be part of a union.

# Template literals

The VariantList type we created earlier looks like this

```typescript
type VariantProp = 'round' | 'square'
type VariantList = VariantProp[]
```

If we wanted the prop to also accept definitions for margins in the format `margin:<valid css value for margin>`, how would we do so?

That's where template literal types come in. 

```typescript

// This says: I only accept 'auto' or a number as my value
type MarginValues = number | 'auto'

// `margin:${MarginValues}` works just like JS string interpolation, but for types. 
// We're basically saying we want a string that starts with 'margin:' and 
// ends with either 'auto' or a numerical value
type VariantProp = 'round' | 'square' | `margin:${MarginValues}`


type VariantList = VariantProp[]

const a:VariantList = ['square', 'margin:10'] // Success
const b:VariantList = ['square', 'margin:auto'] // Success

// Error, since 'randomValue' is not a member of the MarginValues union
const c:VariantList = ['square', 'margin:randomvalue'] 
```
