# Branching

To save us from becoming a complete mess, we follow a basic git flow (see below). As of now we don't need anything fancy. The orange lane represents hot-fixes, the blue one in the middle the master version, and the green lanes are for developing features or experimenting.

<img src={image} style={{ width: '100%', height: 'auto', backgroundColor: 'red' }}/>

First of all, I really recommend using SourceTree or some other visual git inspector so that you can actually understand what the hell is going on.

Branches must be named as "type/YYMM-name", YYMM being the due milestone. For example:

> feature/YYMM-something-new
> 

> fix/YYMM-some-bug
>
