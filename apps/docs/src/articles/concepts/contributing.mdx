# Contributing

- It is worth reminding that our entire documentation is a constant work in progress.

- For development tasks, when starting every project it is best to go through the main features and considering whether we need to implement any improvements into the template that could be used in future apps, so we keep adding to our pool of available resources.

- Similarly, if you have any suggestions on how to improve our Notion docs, please let us know! Let's write down great documentation together :)
