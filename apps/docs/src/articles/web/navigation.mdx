## What is it

> INFO The base logic of this tool is complete, but we are still improving it and the documentation will be updated with the improvements.

It is common to repeat this code in several places:

```tsx
navigate('/auth/login')
```

This is not scalable and is problematic since on many occasions a certain path can change due to customer request or project needs, and the result is changing a line of code in several parts of the code, which can easily cause bugs.

Finally, this new Navigation system was created, where all the application's routes are concentrated in one variable, making changes **faster** and **safer**.

Other important details are:

- The way to write the route was created to completely mirror mobile navigation so that the developer does not feel so much difference between platforms.
- The navigate function has full typescript support, so when the developer needs to write, he will have a list of available routes:

## ROUTES variable

It is located in: **src/app/constants.ts**

```ts
export const ROUTES = {
  Home: '/',
  Profile: {
    Edit: '/profile/edit',
  },
  Auth: {
    Login: '/auth/login',
    Signup: '/auth/signup',
    ForgotPassword: '/auth/forgot',
  },
  About: '/about',
  CrudExample: '/crud',
  Playground: '/playground'
}
```

For you to add a new route or change one, you must follow the same pattern as the others.

## How to use

You can call any function, just like the default **navigate**.

```tsx
import { Navigation } from '@/utils'

Navigation.navigate('Route.Example')
```

Routes with dynamic parameters or search params can be written as:

```tsx
import { Navigation } from '@/utils'

Navigation.navigate('Route.Example', { 
  route: '12', 
  params:  {
    name: 'Test',
    email: 'test@email.com'
  }
})
```
The **route** property will be concatenated to the route path, and everything in **params** will be concatenated as search params to the route, the result of the route will be:

```
route/example/12?name=Test&email=test@email.com
```

This writing system and typescript support is also available in the **Link** and **Redirect** components

```tsx
return <>
  <Link route='Route.Example'>
    Link
  </Link>

  <Redirect to='Route.Example' />
</>
```
