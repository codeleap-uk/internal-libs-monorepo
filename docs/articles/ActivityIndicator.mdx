## Props

- **component** (optional, React.ComponentType): A custom component to be rendered as the loading indicator. If not provided, a default loading animation is displayed.
- **size** (optional, number): The size of the loading indicator. It defines the width and height of the component in pixels.

## Example Usage

```javascript
import { LoadingIndicator } from "@codeleap/web";

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Loading Example</h1>
      <LoadingIndicator size={30} />
      {/* or */}
      <LoadingIndicator component={CustomLoader} size={40} />
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the example above, the *LoadingIndicator* component is rendered inside the *App* component. It is displayed with a size of 30 pixels. Optionally, a custom loader component *CustomLoader* can be provided to render the loading animation instead of the default one, with a size of 40 pixels.
