## Props
- `icon` (optional): This prop specifies the name of the icon to be displayed. It should be a string that corresponds to one of the available icons.
- `name` (optional): This prop also specifies the name of the icon to be displayed. It should be a string that corresponds to one of the available icons.

## Example Usage
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { IconButton } from '@codeleap/web';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <IconButton icon="home" />
      <IconButton name="settings" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```
In the example above, the IconButton component is imported from the "@codeleap/web" package. Two instances of the IconButton component are rendered in the App component, each displaying a different icon ("home" and "settings").
